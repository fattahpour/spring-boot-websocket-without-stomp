# Spring Boot Websocket Without Stomp

## What is the Websocket
>A WebSocket is a low-latency (real-time), full-duplex (bidirectional), long-running (persistent), single connection (TCP) between a client and server. WebSockets provide a huge benefit for real-time, event-driven web applications and are becoming more common to power real-time data updates and synchronization, live text chat, video conferencing, VOIP, IoT control and monitoring. They are used for a variety of apps in gaming, social and collaborative networks, logistics, finance and home, vehicle and industrial automation to name a few. Most major web browsers currently support their use. **wikipedia**
